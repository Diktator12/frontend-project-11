## ðŸ“Œ Description
**RSS** is a specialized format designed to describe news feeds, article announcements, and other materials. This is the easiest way for websites (usually blogs) to allow users to subscribe to changes. Special services called RSS aggregators are used for this. These services can query website RSS feeds for new posts and display them in a convenient form, marking what has been read, etc.

**RSS Reader** is a service for aggregating RSS feeds, which makes it convenient to read a variety of sources, such as blogs. It allows you to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, updates them and adds new entries to the general stream.
